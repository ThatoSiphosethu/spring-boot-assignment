                <h1>Chakalaka - A Southern African Side Dish</h1>
                <br>

                <p>Simple yet pleasing in every way, this South Africanâ€“born spicy vegetable side can be as spicy or as mild as you like it.
                    It all depends on you and which direction you want to go.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Chakalaka is a dish that originates from South Africa, and it is staple throughout the country. Mostly during celebrations, gathering and a must-have during braais (South African barbecues).
                    Legend has it that-it was developed by Mozambican men working in the goldmines - they put together vegetables on hand together with canned beans to form a great relish to pair with their starchy side.</p>
